description: 'Image accompanying student project: Roli Boli. Roli Boli are happy spherical
  creatures that are passed between players through flexible colorful tubes. The tubes
  are designed to be held around the back of the head so as the Roli passes through
  the tube, the player can hear a fun buzzing ringing sound. The lengths of tube are
  joined with foam joints.

  and adviser James Penn.'
